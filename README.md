# MacNCheese
### Windows games on Mac, made free & easy.

The spiritual successor to [Whisky](https://github.com/Whisky-App/Whisky) — no subscriptions, no paywalls, just games.

MacNCheese is a simple app that lets you install and play Windows games on your Mac using Wine, with all the graphics stuff (DXVK, MoltenVK, Vulkan…) handled automatically so you don't have to touch the terminal.

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### Step 1 — Before you begin: download Steam for Windows
Go to [store.steampowered.com](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and download **SteamSetup.exe** (the Windows version). Save it to your **Downloads** folder. You'll need this later.

### Step 2 — Download & Install MacNCheese
1. Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/mont127/MacNdCheese/releases) page
2. Open the `.dmg` file
3. Drag **MacNCheese** into your **Applications** folder
4. Open the app from Applications

### ⚠️ Mac says the app "can't be verified"?
That's just macOS being overprotective. Here's how to fix it:

1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down until you see a message about MacNCheese being blocked
3. Click **"Open Anyway"**
4. Enter your Mac password if asked
5. Open the app again — it'll work now ✅

### Step 3 — Install everything with one click
Once the app is open, click the **Install** button. It'll automatically download and set up Wine and all the other stuff it needs. Just wait for it to finish.

### Step 4 — Install Steam
Click the **Install Steam** button. The Steam installer will pop up — go through it like normal and log into your Steam account when it asks.

> 🔝 **To open Steam later**, use the **Steam button at the top of the app**.

### Step 5 — Install & launch your game
1. Open Steam (top of the app), find your game, and install it
2. Come back to MacNCheese — your game should appear in the list
3. Select it and hit **Launch** 🎮

> **Not sure which backend to pick?** Just leave it on **Auto** — it'll figure it out.

## ❓ FAQ

### 🤔 What even is this?
MacNCheese is a free launcher that runs Windows games on macOS using Wine. It automatically sets up all the technical stuff (graphics translation layers, DLL overrides, etc.) so you don't have to.

### 💸 Is it free?
100% free and open source, forever.

### 🆚 Is it better than CrossOver?
CrossOver is a paid product with official support. MacNCheese is free and community-built. For casual gaming it works great — but if you need professional support, CrossOver exists for that.

### 🥃 Is it a replacement for Whisky?
It's the spiritual successor — Whisky is no longer maintained, and MacNCheese picks up where it left off with a focus on Steam games and modern graphics backends.

### 🎮 What kinds of games work best?
- ✅ DirectX 11 games (most common)
- ✅ Unity games
- ✅ DirectX 12 games (with VKD3D-Proton)
- ⚠️ DirectX 9 games (hit or miss)
- ❌ Games with kernel-level anti-cheat (EAC, BattlEye, Vanguard) — these will **not** work

### 🛡️ Why don't anti-cheat games work?
Anti-cheat software like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye require deep Windows system access that Wine can't provide. This is a Wine limitation, not a MacNCheese one.

### 🖥️ Does it work on Intel Macs?
Officially, **no** — MacNCheese is built and tested for **Apple Silicon** (M1, M2, M3, M4…). Intel Macs are not the target. You *might* get it running from source (see below), but it's not supported.

### 🎯 What backend should I use?
Leave it on **Auto** and let the app decide. If you're curious:

| Backend | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **DXVK** | Most DirectX 10/11 games |
| **VKD3D-Proton** | DirectX 12 games |
| **DXMT** | Experimental DX11 via Metal (bleeding edge) |
| **Mesa** | Fallback / debugging |

### ❓ My game says "DirectX 11 not available"
The graphics backend didn't load properly. Try:
1. Making sure Wine is installed (click Install Wine)
2. Switching backends (try DXVK)
3. Re-launching the game

### 🗂️ Do Steam and the game need to be in the same Wine prefix?
Yes. Keep everything in the same prefix (the default one is fine) and it'll all work together.

### 💡 Why does this exist instead of just using the terminal?
Because setting this up manually is painful, repetitive, and full of obscure commands. MacNCheese does it once so you never have to again.

## 🔧 Building Manually (for nerds)

> You only need this if you're on Intel or want to run from source. Normal users should just [download the app](https://github.com/mont127/MacNdCheese/releases).

**Requirements:**
- macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

**Run from source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mont127/MacNdCheese/
cd MacNdCheese
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r ./requirements.txt
uv run MacNCheese.py
```

**Manual full setup (the hard way):**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand — only if you enjoy suffering 😅</summary>

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
brew install mingw-w64 meson ninja molten-vk vulkan-sdk glslang wine-stable p7zip
```

### 2. Build DXVK
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Gcenx/DXVK-macOS.git
cd DXVK-macOS

mkdir -p "$HOME/dxvk-release"

meson setup "$HOME/dxvk-release/build.64" \
  --cross-file "$HOME/DXVK-macOS/build-win64.txt" \
  --prefix "$HOME/dxvk-release" \
  --buildtype release \
  -Denable_d3d9=false

ninja -C "$HOME/dxvk-release/build.64"
ninja -C "$HOME/dxvk-release/build.64" install
```

### 3. Set up a Wine prefix
```bash
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/wined"
wine wineboot
```

### 4. Install Steam
Download `SteamSetup.exe` from the official Steam website, then:
```bash
wine "$HOME/Downloads/SteamSetup.exe"
```
Complete the installer, then launch Steam:
```bash
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/wined"
cd "$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam"
wine steam.exe -no-cef-sandbox -vgui
```
Log in and install your game.

### 5. Copy DXVK DLLs into the game folder
```bash
GAME_DIR="$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/YOUR GAME NAME"
cp "$HOME/dxvk-release/bin/dxgi.dll" "$GAME_DIR/"
cp "$HOME/dxvk-release/bin/d3d11.dll" "$GAME_DIR/"
cp "$HOME/dxvk-release/bin/d3d10core.dll" "$GAME_DIR/"
```

### 6. Launch the game
```bash
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/wined"
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dxgi,d3d11,d3d10core=n,b"
export DXVK_LOG_PATH="$HOME/dxvk-logs"
export DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=info

cd "$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/YOUR GAME NAME"
wine "YourGame.exe"
```
